# [Build and Train a Machine Learning Model Locally](#file:Build%20and%20Train%20a%20Machine%20Learning%20Model%20Locally.ipynb-context)
This document outlines the steps involved in deploying a machine learning model to a real-time inference endpoint using AWS SageMaker. The process is divided into several key sections, each focusing on a critical aspect of the deployment process.

### 1.1 Automatic Creation of an S3 Bucket

- **Purpose**: Set up an S3 client and define locations within your default S3 bucket for storing model artifacts.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Automatically create a write bucket named `sagemaker-<your-Region>-<your-account-id>`.
  - Use a publicly accessible S3 bucket named `sagemaker-sample-files` for training datasets.

### 1.2 Create a SageMaker Model from the Model Artifact

- **Purpose**: Prepare the model artifact for deployment by creating a SageMaker model.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Retrieve the SageMaker managed XGBoost image.
  - Specify a unique model name and create the model if it does not already exist.

### 1.3 Create an Endpoint Configuration

- **Purpose**: Specify properties for the deployment, including instance type and count.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Define an endpoint name and check if it exists.
  - Create an endpoint configuration with the specified properties.

### 1.4 Create the Endpoint Using the Endpoint Configuration

- **Purpose**: Deploy the model to a real-time inference endpoint.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Use the previously created endpoint configuration to create the endpoint.
  - Monitor the endpoint's status until it is fully created.

### 1.5 Invoke the Inference Endpoint

- **Purpose**: Test the deployed model by invoking the endpoint with test data.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Fetch test data and serialize it for the inference request.
  - Invoke the endpoint and process the response.

### 1.6 Inspect Payload

- **Purpose**: Analyze the data sent to and received from the SageMaker inference endpoint to ensure the quality and correctness of both requests and responses.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Check if data capture is enabled and wait for the captured data to be uploaded to S3.
  - Use the `S3Downloader` utility from the SageMaker SDK to list and read the captured data files.
  - Decode the base64 encoded input and output data for inspection.

### 1.7 Detailed Auto Scaling Configuration

- **Purpose**: Provide a detailed guide on setting up auto scaling for the SageMaker inference endpoint to handle varying loads efficiently.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Configure a scaling policy detailing the minimum, desired, and maximum number of instances for the endpoint.
  - Register the scalable target with SageMaker's auto scaling service.
  - Create a target tracking scaling policy.

### 1.8 Stress-test the Endpoint

- **Purpose**: Evaluate the endpoint's performance and scalability under heavy load by simulating a high volume of inference requests.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Continuously invoke the endpoint with test data for a specified duration to simulate a high-traffic scenario.
  - Monitor the endpoint's status and instance count during and after the stress test.

## 2. Build and Train a Machine Learning Model Locally

[Open Notebook](#file:Build%20and%20Train%20a%20Machine%20Learning%20Model%20Locally.ipynb-context)
This section will be updated with content relevant to building and training a machine learning model locally.






**Note**: The steps above are a high-level overview of deploying a machine learning model to a real-time inference endpoint using AWS SageMaker. Detailed implementation may require additional steps or modifications based on specific requirements or changes in AWS services.



## Prerequisites for Creating a SageMaker Notebook

To create a SageMaker notebook and follow the tutorial on deploying a model to a real-time inference endpoint, you'll need to meet the following prerequisites:

- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an active AWS account. If you do not have one, sign up at [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- **IAM Permissions**: You must have sufficient permissions to create and manage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon SageMaker notebooks, and endpoints. Specifically, you need permissions to execute SageMaker actions, access S3 resources, and create IAM roles.

- **Amazon S3 Bucket**: An Amazon S3 bucket is required for storing your data and model artifacts. You can use the SageMaker default bucket or create a new one in your AWS account.

- **Familiarity with Python**: Basic knowledge of Python programming is necessary as the tutorial involves running Python code in a Jupyter notebook.

- **AWS CLI and Boto3**: Although not strictly required for all steps, having the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured, along with familiarity with Boto3 (the AWS SDK for Python), can be beneficial for advanced operations or troubleshooting.

- **Region Selection**: Ensure you are operating in an AWS region where Amazon SageMaker is available. Check the [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for availability.

Before starting the tutorial, log in to your AWS Management Console and verify that your account is in good standing.
