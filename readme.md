## Prerequisites for Creating a SageMaker Notebook

To create a SageMaker notebook and follow the tutorial on deploying a model to a real-time inference endpoint, you'll need to meet the following prerequisites:

- **AWS Account**: Ensure you have an active AWS account. If you do not have one, sign up at [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).

- **IAM Permissions**: You must have sufficient permissions to create and manage AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, Amazon S3 buckets, Amazon SageMaker notebooks, and endpoints. Specifically, you need permissions to execute SageMaker actions, access S3 resources, and create IAM roles.

- **Amazon S3 Bucket**: An Amazon S3 bucket is required for storing your data and model artifacts. You can use the SageMaker default bucket or create a new one in your AWS account.

- **Familiarity with Python**: Basic knowledge of Python programming is necessary as the tutorial involves running Python code in a Jupyter notebook.

- **AWS CLI and Boto3**: Although not strictly required for all steps, having the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured, along with familiarity with Boto3 (the AWS SDK for Python), can be beneficial for advanced operations or troubleshooting.

- **Region Selection**: Ensure you are operating in an AWS region where Amazon SageMaker is available. Check the [AWS Regional Services List](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/) for availability.

Before starting the tutorial, log in to your AWS Management Console and verify that your account is in good standing.
