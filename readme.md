# Deploy a Machine Learning Model to a Real-Time Inference Endpoint

This document outlines the steps involved in deploying a machine learning model to a real-time inference endpoint using AWS SageMaker. The process is divided into several key sections, each focusing on a critical aspect of the deployment process.

## 1. Automatic Creation of an S3 Bucket
- **Purpose**: Set up an S3 client and define locations within your default S3 bucket for storing model artifacts.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Automatically create a write bucket named `sagemaker-<your-Region>-<your-account-id>`.
  - Use a publicly accessible S3 bucket named `sagemaker-sample-files` for training datasets.

## 2. Create a SageMaker Model from the Model Artifact
- **Purpose**: Prepare the model artifact for deployment by creating a SageMaker model.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Retrieve the SageMaker managed XGBoost image.
  - Specify a unique model name and create the model if it does not already exist.

## 3. Create an Endpoint Configuration
- **Purpose**: Specify properties for the deployment, including instance type and count.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Define an endpoint name and check if it exists.
  - Create an endpoint configuration with the specified properties.

## 4. Create the Endpoint Using the Endpoint Configuration
- **Purpose**: Deploy the model to a real-time inference endpoint.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Use the previously created endpoint configuration to create the endpoint.
  - Monitor the endpoint's status until it is fully created.

## 5. Invoke the Inference Endpoint
- **Purpose**: Test the deployed model by invoking the endpoint with test data.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Fetch test data and serialize it for the inference request.
  - Invoke the endpoint and process the response.

## 6. Inspect Payload
- **Purpose**: Analyze the data sent to and received from the SageMaker inference endpoint to ensure the quality and correctness of both requests and responses.
- **Key Actions**:
  - Check if data capture is enabled and wait for the captured data to be uploaded to S3.
  - Use the `S3Downloader` utility from the SageMaker SDK to list and read the captured data files.
  - Decode the base64 encoded input and output data for inspection.

## 7. Detailed Auto Scaling Configuration
- **Purpose**: Provide a detailed guide on setting up auto scaling for the SageMaker inference endpoint to handle varying loads efficiently.
- **Key Actions**:
  - **Step 1**: Configure a scaling policy detailing the minimum, desired, and maximum number of instances for the endpoint.
    - Use the `describe_endpoint` API to get the endpoint details.
    - Construct the resource ID required by SageMaker for auto scaling.
  - **Step 2**: Register the scalable target with SageMaker's auto scaling service.
    - Specify the service namespace, resource ID, scalable dimension, and capacity limits.
  - **Step 3**: Create a target tracking scaling policy.
    - Define a policy name and use the `put_scaling_policy` API to create the policy.
    - Configure the policy to scale based on the `SageMakerVariantInvocationsPerInstance` metric.
    - Set target values for average invocations per minute and specify cooldown periods for scaling in and out.
    - 
## 8. Stress-test the Endpoint
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the endpoint's performance and scalability under heavy load by simulating a high volume of inference requests.
- **Key Actions**:
  - **Stress Test**: Continuously invoke the endpoint with test data for a specified duration (250 seconds) to simulate a high-traffic scenario.
    - Randomly select samples from the test dataset for each request.
    - Monitor the endpoint's response time and accuracy under load.
  - **Monitor Endpoint Status**: Check the endpoint's status and instance count during and after the stress test.
    - Use the `describe_endpoint` API to monitor changes in endpoint status and instance count.
    - Identify when the endpoint scales up by tracking the increase in instance count in response to the load.


**Note**: The steps above are a high-level overview of deploying a machine learning model to a real-time inference endpoint using AWS SageMaker. Detailed implementation may require additional steps or modifications based on specific requirements or changes in AWS services.
